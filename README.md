In this repository, I gather my studies on cryptography, theory and practice.

I agree with the statement that cryptography is the primary tool for protecting information and, in cryptography, encryption is a cornerstone of data confidentiality, authentication and integrity. But typically the effectiveness of cryptography depends on context, which means in each context the cryptography method or configuration must be adapted for guarantee one or more of the CIA principle.
