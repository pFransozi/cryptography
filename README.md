# Introduction

In cryptography, encryption is a cornerstone of data confidentiality and the effectiveness of cryptography is typically dependent on context. Cryptography is the primary tool for protecting information and it can be used to provide:

    1. confidentiality: only authorized parties can read the protected information. 
    2. authentication: you know that you are talking to the right entity/person and that they have not delegated their identity.
    3. integrity: a message hasn't been changed between the sender and receiver.
